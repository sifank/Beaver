- Version 0.2, 29211219: 
  - Added driver version to Connection tab, updated config.h.cmake with a Beaver version
  - ISSUES:
    - Can only connect with USB (I'm not able to test the network connection yet - issue with my controller)
    - I caught the dome rotating to Park about 10 secs after bringing up the driver.  This only happened once and I'm not able to reproduce.  Please contact me if you experience this.
    - The Motion fields (Dome CW and Dome CCW) occasionally have issues and crash all of Kstars.  The work-around is to enter the number of degrees you want to move in the "Relative Position" field, using either positive (CW) or negative (CCW) numbers.
- Version 0.1, 20211218:  Initial release in beta.
